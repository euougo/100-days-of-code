**Today's Progress**: Worked on semantic HTML5 base for the site.

**Thoughts:** I was learning HTML5 again, from scratch, I need to practice this again to feel like I am at least confortable at it.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
